# Aries Remote Service Admin (RSA)

The [Aries Remote Service Admin (RSA)](http://aries.apache.org/modules/rsa.html) project allows to transparently use OSGi
services for remote communication. OSGi services can be marked for export by adding a service property 
service.exported.interfaces=*. Various other  properties can be used to customize how the service is to be exposed.

For more information, check out section "122 JPA Service Specification Version 1.0" in the "OSGi Service Platform
 Enterprise Specification, Release 4, Version 4.2" available for public download from the OSGi Alliance.
